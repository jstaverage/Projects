This program is a game written in 68000 assembly language whose theme is the fight against climate change.
It was an exercise to learn more about what is possible using low-level languages and learn more about
the inner working of all our computers. 68000 was developed for the Motorolla 68000 microprocessor which is 
the processor at the heart of the Sega Megadrive, so i didn't reach the height of those genius games programmers
but the game is a bit of fun and actually won some awards in a games competition, go figure!
