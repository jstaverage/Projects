This project is my attempt to create a functioning GUI program with a backend
mySQL database whose purpose is to track Sales Orders from customers, placed
through the Customer side of the Program and its effects on Inventory.
Sales Orders can be converted to Sales Invoices automatically from the Staff
side of the program aswell.
It is not feature complete and once college work dies down I intend to come
back and add more functionality.
Take a look if you like and feel free to guide me on what kind of 
functionality you would add and what fixes, would make it better.
