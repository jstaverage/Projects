# Projects
I am a software student in third year, just trying to get to grips with the many skills 
that are needed to become a successful software developer which is my current singular goal.

This repo is a collection of some of the software projects i have undertaken in the past
year. Take a look if interested and feel free to give back some constructive 
feedback, cause I know I still have a LOT to learn!
