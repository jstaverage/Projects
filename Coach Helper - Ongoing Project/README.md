This project was designed to solve a problem where a Swimming Coach has a smart watch which he uses to record his students swimming times and it sends the data 
a folder on his computer. He wants to be easily able to analysis their times conveniently and he also wants a graph to highlight their progress or otherwise.
This is my currently ongoing project to create software with a GUI interface to satisfy his requirements. 
This software should allow the user to pick a folder from their computer. The program then should read
that folder and if that folder contains files of the correct type, it will output data on that swimmers times, an average time
and generate a graph of their times for analysis. 

If you wish to test the software I have provided the swimdata folder with the times.
